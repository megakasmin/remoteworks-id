## Overview

RemoteWorks ID is a curated job platform focused on **remote and hybrid opportunities**.  
Unlike traditional job boards, every job listing goes through **manual review and trust checks** before being published.

The platform is designed to:
- Help job seekers find **safer, higher-quality job listings**
- Help employers publish **credible and curated opportunities**
- Reduce misleading or scam job postings through internal review

---

## Product Principles

- **Curated, not crowded**  
  Quality over quantity. No mass scraping.

- **Trust-first**  
  Review internal sebelum publikasi.

- **Clear separation of roles**  
  - Job Seeker
  - Employer
  - Internal Review

- **Monetization without harming trust**  
  Paid options affect *speed & visibility*, not approval outcome.

## For Employers

Employers can submit job listings through a dedicated flow:

### Review Options
- **Standard Review (Free)**  
  - Reviewed within 3–5 business days  
  - Basic visibility

- **Priority Review (Optional)**  
  - Reviewed within 24 hours  
  - Higher placement & curated badge  
  - Does not guarantee approval

> Priority Review improves speed and visibility, not trust decisions.

## Trust, Safety & Verification

RemoteWorks ID separates **trust concepts clearly**:

- **Trust & Safety**  
  Platform-wide internal policies and checks  

- **Verification**  
  Optional badge granted after additional internal checks  

This separation prevents confusion and maintains credibility.
